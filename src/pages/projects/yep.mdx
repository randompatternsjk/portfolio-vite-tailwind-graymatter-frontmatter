# Research
Turns out years of blasting **5 spray-and-pray emails** a day and directing customers to an increasingly _hard-to-search_ website left an impression: **Groupon... sucks?**

## Strategy
Sales worked to increase deal quality and quantity in five test markets. Product & Engineering overhauled search functionality to serve up deals with hyperlocal relevance.

## Results
+46% Ad Recall  
+16% Purchase Intent  
+6% Brand Consideration
